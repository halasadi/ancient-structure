# ancient-structure

We want to do model based clustering on modern+Ancient pooled human data, allowing for unobserved ancient ancestry.

We also want to apply Treemix, Admixture and PCA on pooled Ancient datasets from Haak et al (2015) and the Allentoft et al (2015).

The working directory for this repo on the PPS cluster is at : /mnt/gluster/home/kkdey
